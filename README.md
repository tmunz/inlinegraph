inlinegraph
===========

All graphs work with SVG and can be created by using 
$(selector).inlinegraph(values, options);

values
------
To use the content of the tag as parameter, use 'html' as value. If you want to use more values, split them by using comma (","). If the value is not a number, a interception-graphic will be displayed.

A json object is required, as you can see in the examples
